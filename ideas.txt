card mechanics:

Area Control Cards: Cards that temporarily alter the battlefield, such as creating walls, slowing down areas, or zones that heal or buff allies. For example, a "Mystic Barrier" card could create a temporary wall that blocks enemies.

Chain Combo Cards: Cards that increase in power or effect if used in a specific sequence. For instance, a "Fire Chain" card could deal more damage if preceded by a "Spark" card.

Status Effect Cards: Cards that don't deal direct damage but apply effects like stun, poison, freeze, or confusion to enemies. For example, a "Frostbite" card could slow down all enemies in a certain area.

Summoning Cards: Cards that summon creatures or allies for a short duration. These summoned entities could have their own attack patterns or abilities, like a "Guardian Spirit" card summoning a protective entity.

Environmental Interaction Cards: Cards that interact with the game world, like a "Nature's Wrath" card that causes vines to emerge from the ground, entangling enemies.

Utility Cards: Cards that provide non-combat benefits, such as increased movement speed, temporary invisibility, or the ability to see hidden traps or enemies. A "Wind's Grace" card could boost agility for a short time.

Special Event Cards: Rare cards that trigger powerful effects or mini-games, like a "Meteor Shower" card that initiates a brief mini-game where the player aims meteors at enemies.

Synergy Cards: Cards that gain additional effects when used with other specific cards, encouraging players to find effective combinations. A "Lightning Rod" card could become more powerful if used after a "Storm Call" card.

Trap Cards: Cards that set traps on the battlefield, activating when an enemy steps on them. For example, a "Quicksand" card could create a trap that immobilizes enemies.

Resource Manipulation Cards: Cards that affect the player's or enemies' resources, like mana, health, or even card draw speed. A "Mana Drain" card could temporarily reduce an enemy's ability to use special attacks.
